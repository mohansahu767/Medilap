Tech Stack: PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
üßæ Project Overview:

Medilap is a comprehensive healthcare and e-medicose web application built to simplify the process of purchasing medical supplies online. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and order medicines while offering a secure backend for administrators to manage the product catalog, inventory, and user queries.

This project was designed to address the growing demand for online access to medical supplies, especially in remote areas where physical access to pharmacies can be difficult. The application was developed using PHP and MySQL for the backend, and modern front-end technologies like Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an engaging user experience. AJAX was implemented to provide seamless interactions, such as live search and filtering, without page reloads.
üí° Key Features:

    User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to search for medicines using name, category, and price filters.

    Product Management Dashboard: Admins can add, update, or delete products, manage categories, and monitor inventory.

    Live Search and Filter: AJAX-powered search functionality improves usability and speed.

    Performance Optimization: Database schema was optimized to handle over 500 product entries efficiently, resulting in a 20% reduction in query time.

    Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap to ensure compatibility across all device sizes.

üîê Security:

Form validations, session management, and sanitization were implemented to prevent SQL injection and unauthorized access.
üéØ Objective:

To build a scalable, efficient, and secure web platform that allows users to easily access and order medical products from the comfort of their homes.
